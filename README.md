# ✨ TheLightLayer

> This is not just a profile.  
> It's a space where light meets layers of language, logic, and learning.

Welcome to **thelightlayer** — a personal lab where I explore the intersection of  
**AI**, **LLMs**, and **language technologies** through curiosity, clarity, and craft.

### 🧠 What I'm building
- 🤖 Language-driven systems with LLMs & prompt architectures
- 🔬 Lightweight fine-tuning & efficient adaptation techniques
- 🛠 Tools that turn ML models into meaningful workflows
- 🧾 Structured insights from unstructured data

### ☀️ Why “thelightlayer”?

> Every system has layers.  
> But not every layer lets the light in.

In neural networks, we abstract.  
In language, we infer.  
In code, we compose.  
In thought, we layer.

This space is about shining light into complexity—  
Whether it's decoding a transformer block, crafting a prompt chain,  
or writing code that feels like clear thinking.
